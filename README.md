### Part 1: Rendered Images With Generated Maps
##### Description
---
In this notebook, I explored loading a textured mesh from an obj file and configuring the **Renderer** with the **Rasterizer** and **Shader**, while adjusting **camera** and **light** angles. Additionally, I utilized an open-source AI image generator known as **Stable Diffusion** to generate various texture maps for wrapping the object. Then, I re-rendered the mesh with the new textures and visualized the resulting image.
##### Complications

**Main Struggle:** My main struggle involved manipulating variables and data types to ensure compatibility. This often required extensive reference to the [**Pytorch3d documentation**](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d/tree/main/pytorch3d) to understand how each class worked with one another and to address type mismatches when passing parameters. When trying to load in a new texture map to change the mesh's texture is when I ran into my first obstacle.
```python
im = cv2.imread("Path_to_File/new_cow_texture.png")
im = im.astype(np.float32)
im = torch.from_numpy(im/255).to(device)

mesh.textures = TexturesUV(maps=[im], faces_uvs=[faces_uvs], verts_uvs=[verts_uvs])
rendered_image = renderer(mesh)
```
